# Engineering Thesis Project

Analysing efficiency of simulated flow guided medical nano-network consisting of some number of nanobots.
Flow of nanobots is simulated by ns3 module Blood-Voyager-S, then evaluated in four defined scenarios by created python modules

## Scenario 1
Plotting probability density function and distribution method describing chances of delivery in time span of width 30 minutes
as function of time of flow in blood system

## Scenario 2
Plotting mean delivery time as function of number of nanobots

## Scenario 3
Plotting collision rate understood as number of collisions per transmissions as function of number of nanobots
