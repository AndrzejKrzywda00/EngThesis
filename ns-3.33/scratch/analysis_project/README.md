# Data presentation acquired by system

1. Histogram of packet delivery times
2. Time schema of packet delivery (x-axis scaled to whole scenario)
3. Transmission power economy schema

## I scenario
Number of nanobots = 5 (minimum required), times: from 2 minutes to 20 minutes to 1h
We can expect several transmissions with delays of several minutes, or a little more
Having 3 data source points and single reception point makes scenario heavily tilted towards reception transmissions

## II scenario
Number of nanobots = 100
Time = 1h
